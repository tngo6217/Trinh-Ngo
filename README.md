### Goals

-   Complete the Applied Data Science Specialization 

### Boundaries / Scope

-   Complete Course 1 Python for Data Science and AI
-   Complete Course 2 Data Analysis with Python

### Success criteria

-   My own application for data retrieval and processing.
-   Weekly work log with screenshots and summaries to demonstrate activity.

### Constraints

-   I will be auditing the course for free so will be able to read and view the course content but not submit projects or earn the certification.

### Assumptions

-   The courses will be available for the duration of the semester.
-   I have all required software.

### Stakeholders

-   Professor - for grade
-   Parents - investing in my education and future success, want to make them proud
-   Perspective Employers - artifact will be added to my student portfolio which could help with getting a job

### Week 1: Python Basics
1. Types: In Python, there are different types of data. It could be an integer (3), a real number (9.67), or word/sentence which are called string ("Hello")

- To type an integer: type(3). To type a real number: type(9.67). To type a string: type("Hello").
![Sample](https://github.com/tngo6217/Trinh-Ngo/blob/master/Screenshot%202019-10-01%20at%209.42.48%20PM.png)

- If we type float(2), it becomes 2.0; int(1,1), it becomes 1. We can also convert numbers to a string by typing str(1) or str(9.84). The result is gonna be '1' or '9.84'.

- Boolean is also a type in Python with 2 values True or False. If we cast True for an integer 1, and false to 0, when we type int(True) we get 1, int(False) we get 0. Similarly, bool(1) --> True, and bool(0) --> False.

2. Expressions and Variables: Expressions describe a type of operation the computer performs. 
- Mathemetical operations: + adding, - subtracting, * multiplying, or / dividing (the results could be float). We can use // for integer division (ex: 25//6=4 the result is rounded).
- Python follows Mathematical conventions (ex: 3+4/2= 5, it follows dividing first and adding later).

- Variables is to store values. We can assign variables by using : or = (ex: number: 3, or number=3).
- We can store variable of an expression (ex: x: 6+4*5. The result is 26, then x=26).
- We can perform operations on x and save the result on a new variable (ex: x= 26, y=x/2 => y=26/2=13).

3. String Operations: In Python, a string is a sequence of characters. It can be expressed in double quotes or single quotes.(ex: "hello" or 'hello').
- It can be spaces or digits, and also be special characters (ex: "Hello! Do you know 1+1 can be 2 or 11 in Python?")
- Slicing, stride, tuples: slicing (length of the string)
- Escape Sequences: .\ are meant to proceed escape sequences (strings that are difficult to input)
- String: Immutable
